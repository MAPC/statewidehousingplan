# 0.0 Setup - Define helper functions, set knitr path, load necessary packages, set muni data keys

# 0.1 - Set knitr path + root for inputs

```{r}
#Use when Rproject is open
#root <- '../../../../Data/Working/Regional_Control_Totals/'

# Base root. Toggle between S: and K: drive depedning on mapped paths on your computer
base <- "K:/DataServices/Projects/Current_Projects/"
#base <- "S:/Network Shares/K Drive/DataServices/Projects/Current_Projects/"

#General K drive filepath
root <- paste0(base, "/Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/Regional_Control_Totals/")

# Reweighter files path
rwt_path <- paste0(base, "Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/Reweighter/")

#PUMS K drive filepath

#Set output filepath
output_path <- paste0(base, "/Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/PUMS/outputs/")

#Set knitr path
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = pums_path)
