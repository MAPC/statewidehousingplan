Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(survey)
library(srvyr)
library(data.table)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(openxlsx)
library(devtools)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
#Use when Rproject is open
#root <- '../../../../Data/Working/Regional_Control_Totals/'

#General K drive filepath
root <-"K:/DataServices/Projects/Current_Projects/Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/Regional_Control_Totals/"

#PUMS K drive filepath
pums_path <- "K:/DataServices/Projects/Current_Projects/Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/PUMS/ipums_2021/"

rpa_path <- "K:/DataServices/Projects/Current_Projects/Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/Regional_Control_Totals/Scenario_1/"

#Set output filepath
output_path <- "K:/DataServices/Projects/Current_Projects/Housing/StatewideHousingPlan/04_Analysis/Data/Working/PUMS/outputs/"

#Set knitr path
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = pums_path)
```

# 0.2 - Set package dependencies, set environment, set up data keys\*\*

#pums <-read_csv("C:/Users/alessandrasmith/Downloads/pums_multiadult_2021_V_2024-10-09.csv")

      weight.check < 0 ~ 1,
      weight.check == 0 ~ 0,
      .default = 0
    )
  )
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
